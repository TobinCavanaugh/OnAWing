# Upon The Wind

Play as an ethereal bird recovering its plumage.

The bird flies to your mouse position, and you must avoid crashing in order to maintain your speed.

It's a chill and zen-style game, without dramatics or chaos.

This game was made by me (Tobin Cavanaugh)!
I made it in just under 2 weeks.
It was pretty difficult, im not gonna lie.
I learned a lot while working on this project. Its all boring stuff though, like getting better acquainted with shader graph and URP in general
I think that this game came out as well as it could given the constricted timeline, though I do have a few things I wish I could've polished more.
This game started off as a rage game where you had to control each of the birds wings individually, I soon realized that that was a pain to try and program, and decided to go in a more artistic direction.
I took alot of inspiration from studio ghibli stuff, mainly on the clouds and the color pallete, though I have no chance of reaching their level of artistry.
I hope you enjoyed the game!
